# Phase 1: Introduction and Project Brief

In this phase I created some Design IDs (a warm up design exercise), explored potential project ideas, formalized a project idea into a project brief, and wrote a consent narrative to share with user interviewees. All of these artifacts can be found below. 

## Design IDs

## Project Ideation 
Nomadic Living Recommendations
- I believe there’s a market for people who are untethered to any particular geographic location who could use customized recommendations for where to live. These users could be:
  - Online, remote college students who need to rent for a limited time but can be anywhere in the world
  - Professionals who have permanently transitioned to remote work as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and are interested in moving to a new city/town now that they are not tethered by a daily commute
- This service could help with that job to be done by aggregating wants and needs to in turn suggest locations that match the user’s desired hometown
- Potentially similar services/inspiration
  - AirBnB long term stays + experiences provides curated stays and experiences given variable search input parameters
  - College Board College Search provides college recommendations based on want/need/don’t care ranked desires about a college experience

Digital Travel Assistant + Trip Documentation [Google MyTrip]
- I believe there’s a market for people planning trips/vacations who like to do research on places to go and things to do before they go and save their memories after they returned. Sample jobs to be done include:
  - Wanting to plan everything from maps to itineraries for a trip in one location
  - Wanting to save specific places you’ve gone and things you’ve done with images and notes about the experience
- This service could provide one point for maps and itineraries before the trip begins as well as photo albums and journals upon return
- Potentially similar services/inspiration
  - Google My Maps allows users to save specific locations with particular tags and other data to create visual trip guides
  - Google Photos turns pictures and their associated location + date + photo recognition data into order-able photo-albums of past trips users can order
  - Simply Postcard allows users to upload images and messages then prints and mails postcards to a recipient of choice, allowing for custom memories from a trip to be preserved and shared
  
## Project Brief
_What is the problem in brief?_
We believe there’s an area of opportunity for individuals/groups going on vacations who would like an easy method of distilling their trip memories and memorabilia into a shareable keepsake.

_How will your project change the status quo? For whom?_
Whether it’s a family vacation, trip with friends, or weekend getaway, the adventures we take are often full of rich memories worth cherishing. However, creating scrapbooks or home movies is time intensive and cumbersome. By eliminating some of the work required to compile and preserve these memories, we believe we can lower the activation energy required and therefore encourage more people to create lasting records of memories that matter. 

_What information do you need to collect? How will you collect it? How will you meet your target users, or who can serve as effective proxies for them?_
Images and image metadata, text and voice memos, itineraries or location data, background information/blurbs about locations, scanned documents/memorabilia. Imagining that this is a new application created by google, the service could use photos, calendar, location, etc. to access everything without any direct effort on the part of the user. To meet target users I spoke with three mothers and a father about their trip documentation experiences. 

## Consent Narrative
Hello! I'm working on a project for a class on user experience design class about digital photo album creation. Since I'm learning to design web interactions that are easy to use, I am looking to do interviews with potential users. If you are able, I would love to take 20 minutes of your time to ask you a bit about your vacation experiences and how you capture the memories after a trip. Thank you for your consideration!
